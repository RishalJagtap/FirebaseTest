#Firebase Test Website
<hr/>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this website is to test the implementation of <b>Firebase</b> into a generic <b>REACT</b> website. Its main functions include gathering data from a set colleection and projecting it onto a webpage. In addition, it features textboxes for user input and an additional button that will add houses to the current list.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The prototype does not feature many uses as of yet, however ideal use would be to hold information and display it if need be. During the concept and creation of the website, the "house" was used as a simple object that could hold a varety of characteristics. This allowed for the manipulation of infomration types such as boolean, strings, integers, and the <b>date</b> type. <br> 
  
In later stages of the project, the goal of the database is to store the information of customers, including user logins aking with thier order. The former data will be hidden while the latter is displayed to the user during use. Another subset could be menu items, which can be altered through the list rather than having to be manually changed in every occurance. </p>

<h2>Improvements<h2>
  
<p> As of now, the website's major function is to display information from the colletion in Firebase. Further improvements would be the completion of the input to allow users to make their own custom choices. In addtion, creating a delete button would be essential to prevent the colletion from being filled with unnecessary data.</p>
